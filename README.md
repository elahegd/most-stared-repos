# MostStaredRepos

The Idea of this mini application is to implement a small webapp that will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days. You'll be fetching the sorted JSON data directly from the Github API.

## Features

- Infinite scroll to load more repositories
- Repository cards showing:
  - Name (clickable)
  - Description
  - Stars
  - Issues
  - Owner info with avatar
  - Last pushed date (using custom pipe)
- Modal window for viewing detailed repo info
- Star-based (1â€“5) user rating system
- Retry mechanism on data fetching failure
- Unit tests for components and services
